# [OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org/) configs repositories

Did you ever felt like you forgot to export your favorite config file from your old **openTTD** server after 2 years of no playing it?
I know that I do, so I created a repository for all of my configs that are worth it!

Do you want to store your config here? No problem! Just create a pull request with it!

### Useful links:
* [Official config website](https://wiki.openttd.org/Openttd.cfg)

### Available scenarios:
